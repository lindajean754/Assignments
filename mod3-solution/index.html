Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.  In fact, chicken has long been considered a healthy alternative to red meat. And it is indeed low in saturated fat, contains higher amounts of omega-6 fatty acids than other animal meats, and is high in protein and essential vitamins and minerals such as B6, B12, iron, zinc, and copper.<br><br>2 Piece Meal<br>4 Piece Meal<br>8 Piece Bucket<br><br>Meals come with 2 sides and a roll.<br>Buckets come with 2 family size sides and 6 rolls.

    <div class="box"><p class="beef">Beef</p><p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, also known as red meat, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.<br><br>Do humans need beef in their diet?<br><br>Red meat has high amounts of protein, which helps promote muscle growth, and vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. For example, a 3-ounce serving has about 45% of the Daily Value (DV) of protein and 35% of the DV for B12. A serving of red meat is also a good source of zinc, which can help the body produce testosterone, and selenium, a powerful antioxidant. Plus, red meat is rich in iron. However, Dr. Hu says that you don't need to eat red meat to get these essential nutrients. You can get the same amounts — and in some cases even more — from poultry, fish, eggs, and nuts, and as well as by following a plant-based diet. But if you decide to eat beef, these are the best cuts.<br><br>Filet Mignon<br>NY Strip Steak<br>Top Sirloin<br>Ribeyes<br>Porterhouse<br>

    <div class="box"><p class="sushi">Sushi</p><p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. Here are six most common types of Sushi.   &nbsp Enjoy!!<br><br>
       1. <b>Nigiri</b> consists of thinly sliced, raw fish pressed on top of sushi rice.<br>
       2. <b>Sashimi</b> consists of thin slices of raw fish such as salmon or tuna. It is not served with rice, but is usually be served on a bed of daikon radish.<br>
       3. <b>Maki</b> is rolled sushi, and probably what you think of when someone mentions the delectable Japanese dish. Fish, veggies, or other ingredients are rolled in rice and wrapped with seaweed.
       4. <b>Uramaki</b> is considered western-style sushi. It's basically maki that's inside out. The rice is on the outside and the seaweed is on the inside.<br>
       5. <b>Temaki</b> is really cool. While standard rolls (maki and uramaki) are rolled with the help of a bamboo mat, temaki is rolled by hand. Because it's rolled differently, temaki is coned shaped and larger than your average sushi roll.<br>
       6. <b>Tempura rolls</b> are basically deep fried maki or uramaki rolls. Tempura itself is basically a method of frying fish or vegetables in a light batter made of flour, water, and eggs.
